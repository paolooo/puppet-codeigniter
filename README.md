Puppet Module Codeigniter
=========================
by Nino Paolo Amarillento

Puppet Module for the latest version of  Codeigniter - PHP Framework.

As of Feb 25, 2013 - this will download <strong>Codeigniter 2.1.3</strong>


Packages
--------

I included Codeigniter Package Manager - [getsparks.com](http://getsparks.org) - in this installation.

Installation
------------

I assumed that you have Vagrant environment already, or if you don't have one yet, you can download and run [vagrant-lamp](https://github.com/paolooo/vagrant-lamp).
    
    
<b>On git root or toplevel directory</b> run the following.  

If you are using my [vagrant-lamp](http://github.com/paolooo/vagrant-lamp)    

* `git submodule add https://github.com/paolooo/puppet-codeigniter.git extras/modules/codeigniter`
